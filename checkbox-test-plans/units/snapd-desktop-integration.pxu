 PURPOSE:
       Check that snapd-desktop-integration works properly
 BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE AND SETUP:
       The daemon to be tested is at io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration, and what has to be tested is the io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration interface of the /io/snapcraft/SnapDesktopIntegration object.
       The four methods of the SnapDesktopIntegration object are:
           - ApplicationIsBeingRefreshed(string application_name, String lock_file, Dict of {String, Variant} extra_parameters)
           - ApplicationRefreshCompleted(string application_name, Dict of {String, Variant} extra_parameters)
           - ApplicationRefreshPercentage(string application_name, String bar_text, Double percentage, Dict of {String, Variant} extra_parameters)
           - ApplicationRefreshPulse(string application_name, String bar_text, Dict of {String, Variant} extra_parameters)
       These functions will be tested in a program called d-feet. Here is how to get setup for testing these functions in d-feet:
           1. Install it with `sudo apt install d-feet`
           2. Run the application
           3. With d-feet you can search in either "System Bus" or "Session Bus". For testing snapd-desktop-integration, we want to search in "Session Bus" so click that.
           4. In the search bar, type "desktopintegration" and it will find one object, io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration
           5. Once you select io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration in the left panel, you can expand the /io/snapcraft/SnapDesktopIntegration object to find the four methods to test. See https://github.com/ubuntu/desktop-snaps/blob/stable/checkbox-test-plans/unit-assets/snapd-desktop-integration_d-feet.png. The object path is: /io/snapcraft/SnapDesktopIntegration -> Interfaces -> io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration -> Methods to find the four methods to test.
           6. Proceed with the four test cases below.

 TEST CASE 1:
      1. Create a non-empty temporal text file (let’s say: /var/lib/snapd/inhibit/test.lock; it must be in a place reachable by SnapdDesktopIntegration):
         $ sudo cat /var/lib/snapd/inhibit/test.lock
         30
      2. In d-feet, double click on ApplicationIsBeingRefreshed in the right panel, to open the "Execute D-Bus Method" window   
      3. Put this in the "Method Input" box:
         "app1","/var/lib/snapd/inhibit/test.lock",{"wait_change_in_lock_file": GLib.Variant("b", True)}
      4. Click on "Execute"
      5. You should see a progress window appear saying that “app1” is being refreshed, and with a pulsed progress bar moving left-to-right and vice-versa.
      6. With the progress window open, go delete the /var/lib/snapd/inhibit/test.lock file in a terminal and the progress window should go away.

 TEST CASE 2:
      1. In d-feet, double click on ApplicationIsBeingRefreshed in the right panel, to open the "Execute D-Bus Method" window   
      2. Put this in the "Method Input" box:
         "app1","",{}
      3. Click on "Execute"
      4. You should see a progress window open saying that “app1” is being refreshed, and with a pulsed progress bar moving left-to-right
      5. Press the "Hide" button and the window must disappear.

 TEST CASE 3:
      1. In d-feet, double click on ApplicationIsBeingRefreshed in the right panel, to open the "Execute D-Bus Method" window   
      2. Put this in the "Method Input" box:
         "app1","",{"message": GLib.Variant("s", "a new message")}
      3. Click on "Execute"
      4. You should see a window appear saying "a new message", and with a pulsed progress bar moving left-to-right
      5. Go back to the main d-feet window and double click on ApplicationRefreshComplete
      6. In the ApplicationRefreshComplete window, put this in the "Method Input" box:
         "app1",""
      7. Click on "Execute"
      8. The app1 window should close

 TEST CASE 4:
      1. In d-feet, double click on ApplicationIsBeingRefreshed in the right panel, to open the "Execute D-Bus Method" window   
      2. Put this in the "Method Input" box:
         "app1","",{"message": GLib.Variant("s", "a new message")}
      3. Click on "Execute"
      4. You should see a window appear saying "a new message", and with a pulsed progress bar moving left-to-right
      5. Go back to the main d-feet window and double click on ApplicationRefreshPercentage
      6. In the ApplicationRefreshPercentage window, put this in the "Method Input" box:
         app1","bar text",0.3,{}
      7. Click on "Execute"
      8. The app1 window should change to a "completion" mode, static at 30% from the beginning, and the text "bar text" must appear over the progress bar.
      9. Go back to the ApplicationRefreshPercentage window and put this in the "Method Input" box:
         app1","bar text",0.6,{}
      10. Click on "Execute"
      11. The app1 window should update to 60% from the beginning, and the "bar text" shoudl go away
      12. Go back to the main d-feet window and double click on ApplicationRefreshPulsed and put this in the "Method Input" box:
          "app1","more bar text",{}
      13. Click on "Execute"
      14. The progress bar must return again to a pulsed bar, and the text "more bar text" must appear over the progress bar
      15. Go back to the main d-feet window and double click on ApplicationRefreshComplete
      16. In the ApplicationRefreshComplete window, put this in the "Method Input" box:
          "app1",""
      17. Click on "Execute"
      18. The app1 window should close
