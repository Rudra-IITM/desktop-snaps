 PURPOSE:
       Check that epiphany runs and works correctly
 STEPS:
      1. Run epiphany from the desktop icon. Does the icon look correct?
      2. Make sure hamburger menu -> Help brings up the Help page
      3. Go to some websites:
         - search for something and expect a duckduckgo result
         - youtube.com - Play a video. Make sure it plays and sound works. Also keep a video running for some time. The screen should be kept on after the inactivity period.
         - markshuttleworth.com - In the address bar, there should be a Reader Mode icon. Click it. Reader mode should work correctly.
         - get.webgl.org - You should have WebGL support and see something like a 3D box with "Your browser supports WebGL".
      4. Close the browser leaving a tab opened with a web page. Relaunch. It should load your previous session.
      5. Set as default browser when opening the browser. Relaunch. The "set browser as default" banner should be gone.
      6. Add a bookmark. Relaunch. Visit the bookmark. Remove it. The behavior should be as expected.
      7. Save a file to the home folder. You should be able to navigate your directories, choose one and the file should be saved there.
