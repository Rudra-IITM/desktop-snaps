This is a how-to guide on setting up checkbox on a 22.04 VM and executing manual tests with it. We ultimately would like to automate the checkbox test cases, with the use of other tools down the road.

Because a GitHub runner, running a workflow on ‘ubuntu-latest’, will be running 22.04, we will start with a fresh 22.04 VM.

## First time setup

The very first time checkbox is setup on a system for testing, you will need to do a small amount of one-time setup tasks

### General tools needed

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-distutils-extra
```

### Setting up checkbox

```bash
sudo snap install checkbox22
sudo snap install checkbox --classic
```

### Create an empty side-loaded provider

```bash
mkdir -p /var/tmp/checkbox-providers && cd /var/tmp/checkbox-providers
checkbox.checkbox-cli startprovider --empty com.desktop-snaps:myprovider
```

## Creating the first test plan for the provider

This is most useful really for someone doing the initial setup of checkbox, including writing the very first project test plans. 

### Create a test plan

```bash
mkdir com.desktop-snaps\:myprovider/units && cd com.desktop-snaps\:myprovider
vim units/gnome-calculator.pxu
```
```
plugin: manual
id: my-first-job
flags: simple
_description:
 PURPOSE:
   	Check that gnome-calculator runs and works correctly
 STEPS:
  	1. Launch gnome-calculator from the desktop icon
  	2. Make sure the theme is correct
  	3. Make sure 2+2=4
  	4. Make sure hamburger menu -> Help brings up the Calculator Help page

unit: test plan
id: gnome-calculator-tp
name: gnome-calculator test plan
include: my-first-job
```

### Run the test plan

```bash
checkbox.checkbox-cli
```
```

### Running one test

Run checkbox from the command line:
```bash
checkbox.checkbox-cli
```

Search the database with the "/" character. Start typing the app for testing. For example, you can search for "calculator" to discover the gnome-calculator test plan.

![search-database](readme-assets/search-database.png)

Then arrow down to highlight the line; space bar to select it. Hit enter.

![arrow-down](readme-assets/arrow-down.png)

Hit T to begin testing.

![checkbox-running](readme-assets/checkbox-running.png)

### Running all tests

Follow the same steps as for "Running one test" except search for "snap test" to find the test plan called "Run all desktop-snapers snap test plans".
